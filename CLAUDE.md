### Key Design Principles

- **Pure logic / rendering split:** `core/` has zero Phaser imports. All game logic is pure functions, trivially testable. `scenes/` and `ui/` are the only Phaser-aware code.
- **Event-driven battles:** The battle state machine emits typed events. Scenes subscribe for animations/UI.
- **Object reference mutation:** BattlePokemon objects are mutated in place. Same references persist across scene transitions via Phaser registry.
- **No external assets:** All sprites generated from code at boot. Music is procedural Web Audio.

## Game Flow

```
TitleScene → StarterSelectScene → MainMenuScene (town hub)
                                      ↕
                                  MapScene (dungeon)
                                      ↕
                                  BattleScene
```

- **Town:** Heal at PokeCenter (20g), buy items at PokeMart, buy previously-seen Pokemon (species must be encountered in battle first to unlock), buy eggs (common/rare/legendary) that hatch after N steps in dungeons, manage moves, select party of 3, enter adventure
- **Adventure:** Single room per run. Find the exit in a fog-of-war grid. Random encounters based on world-specific Pokemon pools. Gold drops on floor tiles. `Repel` suppresses encounters for 20 steps; `Map` reveals the whole grid.
- **Battle:** Cooldown-based moves (CD 0 = always available, CD 1-3 = wait that many turns). Speed determines turn order. XP awarded to alive party on enemy faint. Enemy parties can have multiple Pokemon, scaling with world/room.
- **Progression:** 8 worlds × 25 rooms each. Boss rooms at 5/10/15/20/25 spawn a rare out-of-pool species at elevated level. Clearing a room heals party and advances progress. Defeat loses 15% gold and returns to town (no auto-heal).

## Combat System

- **Cooldown moves:** CD 0 (basic, every turn), CD 1 (wait 1 turn), CD 2 (wait 2), CD 3 (wait 3)
- **Damage:** `((2*level/5+2) * power * (atk/def)) / 65 + 2` × STAB(1.5) × effectiveness × random(0.85-1.0)
- **Stats:** HP, Atk, Def, Spd, Special (Gen 1 single Special)
- **15 types:** Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Rock, Ground, Psychic, Poison, Fighting, Flying, Bug, Ghost, Ice, Dragon
- **Status effects:** Burn, Poison, Paralyze, Sleep. Applied by moves with `effect: { type, chance }`. Burn/Poison tick damage each turn; Paralyze/Sleep may skip turns. Tracked on `BattlePokemon.statusEffects`, emitted as `status_applied`/`status_damage`/`status_skip` events.
- **Switching** costs your turn. Enemy still attacks.
- **Items in battle:** Potion (+30 HP), Super Potion (+60 HP), Revive (25% HP on fainted). Using an item costs your turn.
- **Field items:** Escape Rope (leave dungeon), Repel (20 encounter-free steps), Map (reveal full grid).

## Data Model

- `BattlePokemon` — runtime instance with mutable HP, XP, cooldowns, statusEffects, `statBonuses` (persisted vitamin bonuses, layered via `applyStatBonuses`), and `battleBoosts` (temporary X-item stage counters, reset per battle on the player's roster)
- `PokemonSpecies` — static species data with base stats and `MovePoolEntry[]` (moveId + unlock level), plus `evolvesFrom`/`evolutionLevel` for level-based evolution and `evolutionStone` for stone-based evolution (Raichu, Ninetales, Eeveelutions, etc)
- `ItemData` — carries `category: ItemCategory` (`medicine` · `field` · `vitamin` · `stone` · `candy` · `battle` · `tm`) and optional `param` (stat key, stone id, TM moveId). `applyItem` dispatches by category
- `GameState` — `roster`, `playerParty`, `playerItems`, `gold`, `seenPokemon` (species IDs unlocked in shop), `worlds` progress, `activeWorld`, `currentMap`, `playerX`/`playerY`, `repelSteps`, `eggs` (array of `EggInstance` with tier + stepsRemaining)
- `DungeonMap` — 2D tile grid with fog of war, encounter chances, gold drops, single exit

## Save System

Saves to `localStorage` key `"pokemonGauntlet_save"`. Serializes Pokemon as `{speciesId, level, currentXP, currentHP}` and reconstructs full objects on load. Dungeon state is NOT saved — quitting mid-dungeon loses that run.

## Testing

All `core/` modules have unit tests. Tests use injectable RNG for determinism. Run with `npm test`.

## End-of-Task Workflow (MANDATORY)

Every time you finish a task that changes the game, run through these steps **in order** before telling the user you're done. Do not skip or reorder them.

1. **Make the code changes + run tests** if relevant.
2. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** — append an entry under today's date (see format below).
3. **Update `GAME_DESIGN.md`** — if the change affects gameplay, balance, content, mechanics, economy, progression, or anything a designer/player would care about. Keep this file in sync so it's always a true description of the shipped game.
4. **Update `CLAUDE.md`** — if the change touches architecture (new file in `core/`, new scene, new data module, new top-level system). Keep the Directory Structure and Data Model sections accurate.
5. **Commit** — one logical change = one commit, with a meaningful message (see Git section).
6. **Push to `origin main`** — never leave the session with unpushed commits on `main`.

If any step fails (tests break, push rejected, etc.), stop and surface the problem to the user — do not paper over it.

### CHANGELOG.md format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD

- **<area>:** <one-line summary of what changed and why>
  - optional sub-bullet with file path(s) or extra detail
```

Rules:
- Use the absolute date from the session context — never relative dates like "yesterday".
- Newest date at the top (reverse-chronological). Group same-day entries under a single date heading; add new bullets to the existing top entry if it's already today.
- `<area>` tags: `balance`, `content`, `combat`, `ui`, `map`, `shop`, `save`, `audio`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, `git`.
- One sentence per bullet, focused on the *player-visible effect* or *why*, not a diff recap.
- If the user reverts or changes direction, add a new entry noting the revert — never edit history.

### GAME_DESIGN.md expectations

`GAME_DESIGN.md` is the canonical description of how the game currently plays. Sections it must keep accurate:
- Core loop and scene flow
- Combat system (formula, cooldown tiers, status effects, type chart size)
- World/room structure (count, scaling formulas, boss rooms)
- Shop contents and pricing, PokeCenter cost, gold economy
- Items (battle + field) with current effects
- Egg system (tiers, costs, step counts, pools)
- Save system behavior
- Any forward-looking/aspirational content goes under a clearly-marked **Future Directions** section so it isn't confused with shipped features.

When you change a number (move power, cooldown, shop price, HP heal, encounter rate, etc.), update the matching table/section in `GAME_DESIGN.md` in the same commit.

## Git & GitHub Policy

The repo is hosted at **https://github.com/AdrianCasey-Amplifyx/pokemon-gauntlet** (public), default branch `main`.

- **Commit messages:** present-tense imperative (`add egg shop`, `fix cooldown tick bug`), not past tense. Subject ≤72 chars. Add a body paragraph when the "why" isn't obvious from the subject.
- **Always include** the Claude co-author trailer:
  ```
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```
- **Stage files explicitly by name** when possible — avoid `git add -A` / `git add .` so build artifacts or secrets don't sneak in.
- **Push immediately after committing** so GitHub stays in sync with local. If you're making several related commits in one session, it's fine to push once at the end — but never end a session with unpushed commits on `main`.
- **Never commit:** `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env*`, `.DS_Store`, editor cruft. These are already in `.gitignore`.
- **Branches:** work directly on `main` unless the user asks for a feature branch or PR. If the user requests a PR, create a branch like `feat/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`, push it, and open the PR with `gh pr create`.
- **Destructive operations** (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, branch delete, history rewrite, `--amend` on pushed commits) always require explicit user confirmation — never as a shortcut to "fix" a mistake.
